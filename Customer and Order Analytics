-- In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about order and customer data.

--1)How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(Quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'order id'

--2)How many of those orders were for an iphone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.jansales 
WHERE product = 'iphone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'order id' 

--3)Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.febsales
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'order id' 

--4)Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1

--OR

SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.jansales)

--5)What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.jansales 
GROUP BY product 

--6)Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

--7)How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity)*price AS Avg_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.febsales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON febsales.orderid = customers.order_id 
WHERE febsales.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND ORDERID <> 'Order ID'
