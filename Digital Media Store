-- In this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset named "chinook". This dataset represents a digital media store, which includes 11 tables. Some of the tables include albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, and invoices.
-- By using this dataset in SQLiteStudio, I was able to answer the questions by using the SQL queries below. 

--Show customers who are not in the USA
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE  Country <> 'USA'
ORDER BY Country;

--Show only the customers from Brazil 
SELECT *
